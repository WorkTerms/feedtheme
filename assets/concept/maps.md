```tip
*This scheme lead by 168 to 618 where 168 on π(π(10000)=200 is located on 40
*This 40 is carried to 200 by 102 of (2,60,40) that gives span 60+60+40 or 160
*The 66 of (1,30,30,5) carried 102 to 1000 by the span of 30x30=900 or 1229-329
*By 168 this will be 329+30+30-160 or 229 which is the 50th primes so it span 50
*This 229 carry 1000 to 1229 = π(10000) means it is touching the end of 329 layer
*So the 229 converted to 1000 - 50 or 950 which is 950/10+1 or 96 on the 168 layer
*This leads to 168 - 29 - 96 = 139 - 96 = 43 primes located on the last of 7th row
*This 43 is 18+13+12 in bilateral on perfect square of 9 goes to 89 → π(89²) = 1000
