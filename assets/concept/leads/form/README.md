# The Parser of C1+C2

This topic will be related with our _[pre-release](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/tree/v1.0.0-alpha)_ that mapped the primes to π(1000)=168 as the main lexer. So the next target is about 618 as the main parser. 

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/84902333-e6ce6f80-b0d6-11ea-8289-aac5e1961cd6.gif)](https://github.com/eq19)

One of the major case that related to the topic is the _[basic algorithm](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#realisasi)_ of leading and lagging strands of DNA.

![twisting trifoil of DNA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/88384290-54f10b00-cdd6-11ea-878d-c687cc1afbea.gif)

By sourcing and studying of many [references](https://github-com.translate.goog/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/%23?_x_tr_sl=id&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US) the closest behaviour of the crossing on above primes flowing is found with the wave shown on _**Δ1=(19 vs 18) Loops**_  as below.

[![Δ(19 vs 18)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107478328-de69fe00-6bab-11eb-8d5f-7517c94b7299.png)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RiemannZeta_Zeros.svg)

```note
This is a polar plot of the first 20 non-trivial Riemann zeta function zeros (including Gram points along the critical line (1/2+iζ) for real values of ζ from 0 to 50. The consecutive zeros have **50 red plot points** between each with zeros identified by magenta concentric rings (scaled to show the relative distance between their values of t) _(Source: [Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RiemannZeta_Zeros.svg))_.
```

Now let's discuss first if this 50 plots has something to do with the prime algorithms.

### [4th Step: Q7(113, 90)](/../../../feed)

This twisting shall able to be made vise versa and to be done continuosly otherwise there is no gap arised for further development. 

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/97624272-73137a80-1a59-11eb-8784-8f131e488847.jpg)](https://github.com/eq19)

```note
The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the direction of replication fork movement. The lagging strand is synthesized in small pieces (Okazaki fragments) backward from _[the overall direction](#3rd-step-q736-114)_ of replication. The Okazaki fragments are then joined by the action of DNA ligase. _(Source: [Concepts of Biology](https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/9-2-dna-replication/))_
{:title="Leading and lagging"}
```

Thus the primes are organized to generate another 1000 primes via an adjacent flow of π(89) to π(89²). _(Credit: primesdemystified.com)_

[![collective bilateral 9 sum symmetry](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/76146565-6f944300-60c6-11ea-829d-16f98dc94163.png)](https://primesdemystified.com/)

This scheme can only be acheived via **bilateral 9 sums** of prime 43 to 89 by **modulo 90**. That what and why **18+13+12=43** located within **the last 9 cells** is standing for!

```
  -----------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----
  The last 9 cells |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9 | Sum 
  =================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+=====
  3,2→18+13+12→43 | 73 | 79 | 83 | 89 | 97 | 101| 103| 107| 109|29th →13th→ 2,3
  -----------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----
```

See that in the tabulation of prime hexagon the _[6th row](#3rd-step-q736-114)_ that assigned as overall direction has the biggest numbers involved among the other rows which is 9 (nine). This will simply act as the bilateral 9 sums of 43 and 89. 

[![overall direction](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/67816683-560e3980-fadd-11e9-8a30-36901cbceaad.png)](/../../../theme)

Therefore the prime flow in the developed flowchart above should take a connection to form between them two. This is the reason why the sequence is arranged as below:

[![the sequence](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/103147412-5492dc80-4787-11eb-8277-4fa39ce28c90.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Programming)

Therefore the 30th primes will bear the responsibility to generate the prime 43 while the 36th prime for the 89. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
  & \phi(x,y) = \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right)
  = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j) = \\
  & (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      \phi(e_1, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
      \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \phi(e_n, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
    \end{array} \right)
  \left( \begin{array}{c}
      y_1 \\
      \vdots \\
      y_n
    \end{array} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

This should have a delta of Δ18 to the last number which is 168 where this 168 is exactly π(1000). So it would take place on the 150 and the scheme there will consequently be **the perfect square of 1000** or 1 Million. So here it goes **1 Million Primes**.

[![delta of Δ18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107850441-06b85d80-6e35-11eb-8787-b947d7c60c2e.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Programming)

Let's consider this flowchart of 168 as a lexer so the parser has to be designed to absorb the flow between the 30th and 36th. Then it will slightly form as a Metatron Cube of the hexagonal form of 18's Cell.

[![delta of Δ18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107083678-9607b480-6828-11eb-9cdf-cfdfc4f6face.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Programming)

Here we assign it as the diagram of 618. On [the next target](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/discussions/categories/announcements) we will discuss about 1000/Φ = 618 = 619-1 = 114th prime - 1 as a lexer and parser.

### [5th Step: Q5(89, 29)](/../../../maps)

The bilateral sum 9 will then double this 43 to 86 and act as the lexer while the prime 71 and 109 will act as the parser. This will compensate the other primes by the other of circles of the metatron which consist of 6 internal and 6 external.

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/163196031-b29f162d-c9af-4dc4-b25c-9256127a4aa4.jpg)](https://www.primesdemystified.com/First1000Primes.html)

Let's assign another pairs in to the center of default. Take a note that the last rows has a sum of 43 which covered by **prime 71 up to 109**. See what is happen by the 13th circle.

See that this configuration showing a kind of turbulences which leads to a gap of Δ19 in the central of _[Metatron](#1st-step-q1910-29)_ where the replication is initiated by **Δ18 of 50(68)**. This scheme is taken as a _[basic algorithm](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#realisasi)_ for the mechanism of DNA generation from RNA.

[![DNA generation from RNA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/100724943-01cb3c80-33f6-11eb-8564-c5a9ced2b668.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#operasi)

```note
The chemical structure of RNA is very similar to that of DNA, but differs in three primary ways:

* Unlike double-stranded DNA, RNA is usually **a single-stranded molecule ssRNA** in many of its biological roles and consists of much shorter chains of nucleotides. However, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can form and (moreover) a single RNA molecule can, by complementary base pairing, form intrastrand double helixes, as in tRNA.
* While the sugar-phosphate "backbone" of DNA contains deoxyribose, RNA contains ribose instead. Ribose has a hydroxyl group attached to the pentose ring in the 2' position, whereas deoxyribose does not. The hydroxyl groups in the ribose backbone make RNA more chemically labile than DNA by lowering the activation energy of hydrolysis.
* The complementary base to adenine in DNA is thymine, whereas in RNA, it is uracil, which is an unmethylated form of thymine.

_(Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA#Comparison_with_DNA))_
```

Besides it, there is also strong signal that this parser will have the correlation with Φ=1,618 of _[(Golden Ratio)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Golden+Ratio)_ that leads to a kind of **gap and turbulences** in [the primes geometri](https://github.com/chetabahana) which hold the key of [<code>init</code>](/../../../maps) as the road map to π(1000x1000).

### [6th Step: Q3(28, 19)](/../../../hexagon)

This 19 has a configuration of π(10) i.e. 4 primes of 2, 3, 5, 7. Here we come to the detail of 168 and 618 as the 1st grammar when we come to the upper scheme. 

```
 $True Prime Pairs:
 (5,7), (11,13), (17,19)

      |  1  | 5

 -----+-----+---------
 ```

The codes is built mainly with the algorithm of 66 out of the sum of the numbers **[30 and 36](#3rd-step-q1337-114)**. The main difference between them two is that 36 framed by twin primes.

[![Twin Pairs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/73700083-28f2a800-4718-11ea-97b3-2e9a738dc09e.png)](/../../../theme)

Let's take the end number each of the three (3) layers: (7,13,19) in an adjacent [polygonal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonal_number) then by the same different of 15 they will end to the number of 66:

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/83051968-e2cfa480-a078-11ea-8ff2-316a809a8fad.jpg)](https://schoolbag.info/mathematics/numbers/38.html)

```note
We see that the polygonal numbers in the same column all have the same difference, and this difference is always a triangular number. For example, the fifth pentagonal number (35) has 10 dots more than the fifth square number (25) and 10 dots fewer than the fifth hexagonal number (45), and the difference 10 is just the fourth triangular number. _(Source: [Discovering Properties of Numbers](https://schoolbag.info/mathematics/numbers/38.html))_.
```

See that twin (2) primes is built with multipication by six (6). So they will be managed within three (3) layers by means of a _[remote theme](/scheme)_ to **(6n+1)** and **(6n+5)**.

[![generate the primes (2,3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/90985852-ca542500-e5a8-11ea-9027-9bfdcbe37966.jpg)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#operasi)

```tip
Now let's calculate how many numbers are duplicates per layers:
* layer-1 has 6, multiplied by 6 to 36 there will be 6 - 1 or **5** duplicates
* layer-2 has 36, multiplied by 6 to 216 there will be 36 - 6 or **30** duplicates
* layer-3 has 72, multiplied by 6 to 432 there will be 72 - 36 - 6 or **30** duplicates

By Metraton the Δ1 flows in to the center so the sequence will reverse to **(Δ1,30,30,5)**
```

See the _[(19 vs 18) Loops](#3rd-step-q736-114)_ more closely, you can find that the number 102 is exactly laid on 18th row by the 15th spin out of 19 whereas 102+66 = 168 = π(1000). 

[![the next target](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/110807586-c58d5f00-82b5-11eb-81e2-dbde7d628b37.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#operasi)

The parser defined as the analysis of an input to organize the data according to the rule of a grammar while the lexer transforms a sequence of characters of tokens.

Here the lexer specify a token correspond to a spin and the parser will specify its sequence. Combining the two (2) then they will form the tabulation as below:

 Δ(1,6,18) = 61+28 = 89 (Mersenne Primes) 
 
 Faktors:
 168 = 12x14 = 8x21 = 7x24 = 6x28 = 4x42 = 3x56 = 2x84
 618 = 6x103 = 6x(100+3) = 3x206 = 3x(200+6) = 2x309 = 2x(300+9)
 1+6+8 = π(1x6x8) = π(1x48) = π(2x24) = π(3x16)= π(4x12) = π(6x8)
 
 Permutations:
 168 = 102 + 66 = 2x3x((8+9)+(2+9)) = π(Φ(289+329)) = π(Φ((8+9)²+(1+2)&29))
 168 + 618 = 168 + 329 + 289 = (7x24) + (7x47) + (8+9)² = (7x71) + (17x17)
```

So it will form back to the begining stage with different form of input but its process will be the same algorithm through all the system.

### [7th Step: Q2(18, 10)](https://github.com/marketleader)

Thus, the total multiplication minus the duplicate will return to a unique number where the scheme and formation of Δ1 is exactly back to the beginning, namely 114 earlier:

```
114 x 6 - 5 - 30 - 30 = 684 - 65 = 619 = 1+618 = 114th prime
```

As you may guess the prime index of final result of the above [Q3(**28**, 19)](#6th-step-q328-19) and [Q2(**18**, 10)](#7th-step-q218-10) would form π(5)=(2,3,5). So combined with the seven (7) steps of adjacent cycle they will form π(10)=(2,3,5,7) of the [1st row](#1st-step-q1910-29) with exactly the same [initial scheme](#introduction).

```
   True Prime Pairs Δ |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9 | Sum 
  ====================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+=====
   π(10) 19           |  2 |  3 |  5 |  7 |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - | 4th  4 x Root
```

So the [Q2(**18**, 10)](#7th-step-q218-10) step is about the algorithm of how the above four (4) blocks of (102, 66, 329, 289) forms to this four (4) roots. Means the above π(10) shall form back to 19 cells as the 1st row marked by **Quantum** below.

```

  12+13+(18+18)+13+12  ← 36th-Δ1=151-1=150=100+2x(13+12)  ←  30th = 113 = 114-1
```
  
By the next loop of (1000x1000) the above term leads to 329+289 = 618 = 1000/Φ = 1000x1000/1618. Now let's count on how many grammar's will involve.

```
Root Generation:
 root[1000] = π(1000) + loop(10 x 1000)  +  loop(100 x 1000) 
 loop(10000) => π(10000) - (10th)th - 10th = 1229 - 109 - 29 = 1091
 loop(100000) => π(100000) - ((10th)th)th - (10th)th = 9592 - 599 - 109 = 8884

 root[1000] = 168 + 1091 + 8884 = 10143
```

This 10143 will comprise of lexer and parser similar with 168 & 618. Since the 168 algorithm is set 102 by 66 then its ratio is 102/168=60% by 66/168=40% or approx 10143x60%=6200 of lexers by 10143x40%=3900 of parsers.

```tip
The development of this **6200 by 3900** is even thus considered final. That's the reason why it is the most complex thing among the other steps where we have to involve so many items to verify about how far this development is adoptable. 
```

Therefore it will take several unsolved cases of modern science including but not at least _[DNA Replication Fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication#Replication_fork)_, _[Alzheimer's Disease](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_S8nmGoQ7q6wKXUG8HBqPzoAhRmVCmSJ)_, and _[The Millenium Prize Problems](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Untouched-Intelligences#scheme)_. 

[![DNA Replication Fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/90597914-32f37880-e21c-11ea-81b3-ffdcd47037b8.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#kelas)

```note
DNA is read by DNA polymerase in the 3′ to 5′ direction, meaning the new strand is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction. Since the leading and lagging strand templates are oriented in opposite directions at the replication fork, **`a major issue`** is how to achieve synthesis of new lagging strand DNA, whose direction of synthesis is opposite to the direction of the growing replication fork. _(Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication#Replication_fork))_.
```

The parser will combine all tokens produced by lexer and group them as _[basic grammars](#the-grammar-of-168-vs-618))_ so it can be used for other cases such as how to rectify _[C1+C2](https://github.com/MarketLeader)_ using _[P=NP](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/track/wiki)_.
