# Grammar of eQ19 (10143)

Within next development we will discuss about the interconnection between 168 and 618. Here we will discuss mote detail about the sequence in the [DNA Recombination](#introduction).

[![Remote Theme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/87265280-9b985880-c4ec-11ea-8af1-403fe5648fc5.gif)](/../../../theme)

The pre-release is being developed for _[eBranding](https://github.com/chetabahana)_ within 7 (seven) years. It is still lack the parser 618 of the said _[10143 grammars](#7th-step-q218-10)_ to become usable for every other cases.

All of the layouts are managed with a _[remote theme](/scheme)_ originated by the number of sixty six (66) which is converted to **6 + 6** out of the difference of Δ12 between the primes **23 and 11** using the algorithm of 36 as the perfect square from **6 by 6** using _[Jekyll/Liquid Pages](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/Jekyll-Liquid)_.

This method is considered sufficient enough to recycle all of the grammars on this page up to an [unlimited level](#6th-step-q328-19) just in case you need further explanation in more detail.

```note
In this example, the content from a Markdown document `document.md` that specifies `layout: docs` gets pushed into the {% raw %}`{{ content }}`{% endraw %} tag of the layout file `docs.html`. Because the `docs` layout itself specifies `layout: page`, the content from `docs.html` gets pushed into the {% raw %}`{{ content }}`{% endraw %} tag in the layout file `page.html`. Finally because the `page` layout specifies `layout: default`, the content from `page.html` gets pushed into the {% raw %}`{{ content }}`{% endraw %} tag of the layout file `default.html`.

Although the _[The Pre-release 168](#the-parser-of-618)_ is already running but unfortunately it is not yet user friendly as it could run only in _[GitHub API Platform](https://docs.github.com/en/developers)_ where all of the repos is resided. 

[![lexer and parser](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/71659208-5515b480-2d79-11ea-859f-a20dea0cf680.jpg)](https://github.com/eq19/maps)

Therefore we are going to use _[TensorFlow](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki)_ to connect the pre grammars on [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/admin/overview/about-the-github-enterprise-api) to [Google API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_APIs) to fetch real life data through their machine learning such as _[Big Query](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigQuery)_.

[![Machine Learning](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/123424569-377e7f80-d5eb-11eb-9c85-1f5d72f14eed.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki)

Base on the 19 Cells of _[168 vs 618 tabulation](#6th-step-q328-19)_ then for the 618 it might need 19 minus 7 or another 12 (twelve) years to develope those _10143 grammars_ to become 1st Release.

_So If You're Aware of What This is All About:_<br>
_Just Be Patient and Stay Tuned!_
