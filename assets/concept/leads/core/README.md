# The Lexer of M+F

Human is the only species on earth or might be on the universe who can use a brain to do thinking and learning. Let's discuss about the number of _[23 pairs chromosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome)_.

[![23 pairs of Human Chromosomes)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/96919622-3930fa00-14d6-11eb-86d9-ef60643ed7e5.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome)

See that the number of 23 is a prime that consist of the numbers of **two (2) and three (3)** where both are the only primes under their sum of **five (5)** which is also a prime.

The big question is why 23<br>
Why not 22 or 24 as preliminary discovered?

```note
The number of human chromosomes was published in 1923 by Theophilus Painter. By inspection through the microscope, he counted 24 pairs, which would mean 48 chromosomes. His error was copied by others and it was not until 1956 that the true number, 46, was determined by Indonesia-born cytogeneticist Joe Hin Tjio. _(Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome#History_of_discovery))_
```

The number (2, 3) is in fact the 1st and the 2nd prime. So the number of 23 is built with two (2) or **Double-first primes**. Now let's take a look in to the Double-stranded DNA.

```note
Double-stranded DNA consists of two polynucleotide chains whose nitrogenous bases are connected by **hydrogen bonds**. Within this arrangement, each strand mirrors the other as a result of the anti-parallel orientation of the sugar-phosphate backbones, as well as the complementary nature of the A-T and C-G base pairing (Source: [Nature](https://www.nature.com/scitable/content/double-stranded-dna-6834149/)).
```

![Unit DNA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/101109773-3c0d2780-360a-11eb-9f21-57e2707c7d1e.jpg)

Have you ever notice that the said hydrogen bonds are built with both of the number two (2) and three (3). They are even exist in a single unit of _[DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA)_.

[![Single DNA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/131957473-5a815492-a5f6-49be-9762-9a8921d95dc2.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Untouched-Intelligences#frame)

Despite, it is even not stop there. Have you ever come in your mind that if the number of chromosomes is not 23 pairs, say it is 21 like a monkey or 24 like a gorilla , then human will not able to use their brain as it should. 

```tip
Hydrogen bonds are formed between hydrogen attached to an electronegative atom and an electronegative atom of a different molecules. _(Source: [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-there-two-hydrogen-bonds-between-adenine-and-thymine-but-three-hydrogen-bonds-between-cytosine-and-guanine/answer/Rucious-Heang))_.
``` 
 
Consider if it is in fact generated by nature between the prime 23 and both primes (2,3) which are laid by two (2) times three (3) or **six (6) primes: (5, 7, 11, 13, 17,19)**.

By here onwards this primes will be the major item of our discussion. Now we are going to see what they are going to do with the power of 168 vs 618.

### [1st Step: Q19(10, 29)](/../../../quantum)

So these prime algorithm is again formed by three (3) sets of twin (2) pairs. To make live simpler let.s call them _[True Prime Pairs](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#operasi)_.

[![The True Prime Pairs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/90720864-ab703d00-e2e1-11ea-99c5-70405c78b6e0.jpg)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#operasi)

In term of distribution, these six (6) primes are naturally laid in three (3) forms of 12's multiplication: 5+7=12, 11+13=24 and 17+19=36 where 12+24=36.

```
 $True Prime Pairs:
 (5,7), (11,13), (17,19)
 
 layer|  i  |   f
 -----+-----+---------
      |  1  | 5
   1  +-----+
      |  2  | 7
 -----+-----+---   36 » 6®
      |  3  | 11
   2  +-----+
      |  4  | 13
 -----+-----+---------
      |  5  | 17
   3  +-----+      36 » 6®
      |  6  | 19
 -----+-----+---------
 ```

This 12 all toghether will form (12/2)th = 6th prime = 13 circles including the new one on the center. Thus there are **six (6) primes** in addition to _[the seven (7) steps](#introduction)_ above. So they will perform the **8th up to 13th step** of [Metatron's Cube](https://www.google.com/search?q=metatron%27s+cubes&tbm=isch). 

[![Metatron's Cube](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74094157-4e642500-4b0f-11ea-89b4-eb8cd7d90411.png)](https://www.google.com/search?q=metatron%27s+cubes&tbm=isch)

Let's assign another pairs (5, 7, 11, 13, 17,19) in to a combination so it will turn in reverse (19, 17, 13, 11, 7, 5) lies on the center of default. Now let's force 12 or Δ1 to the **prime 13**. See how those primes reacted to compensate the Δ1 by spreading the gap in to a bunch of Δ's that goes to the **circle 13**.

```
  Tabulate Prime by Power of 10
  loop(10) = π(10)-π(1) = 4-0 = 4
  loop(100) = π(100)-π(10)-1th = 25-4-2 = 19
  loop(1000) = π(1000) - π(100) - 10th = 168-25-29 = 114

  12+13+(18+18)+13+12  ← 36th-Δ1=151-1=150=100+2x(13+12)  ←  30th = 113 = 114-1
```

See that this flows starting from π(10) and finalize by pairing of Δ12. So here we can get the idea of **10 number becoming 10 primes**.

Let's discuss in more detail about the said primes.

### [2nd Step: Q17(30, 36)](/../../../classes)

In the sense of this Δ1 flowing, there will be really hard to cope its algorithm with a such of formula. Let's draw 12 flow arrows in such a way where they have interconnection with 10 objects. 

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/128732737-81762604-0ae0-4a90-b5a8-30921cf46efb.png)](https://github.com/eq19)

The way that we might take is assigning the flowing of the π(10)=4 primes (2,3,5,7) to π(100)=25 and π(1000)=168.

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107818705-98c75400-6daa-11eb-8138-d6da7ceef4fd.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Programming)

Then convert them to 10th prime=29 then to 29 primes up to of (10th)th=29th prime=109 as a flowchart diagram.

[![Flowchart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/103138547-5799b880-4706-11eb-8820-f51cbd57d367.png)](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/)

Let's enter the journey of making **10<sup>n</sup> numbers becoming 10<sup>n</sup> primes** by the Δ1 flowing within the prime pairs.

### [3rd Step: Q13(37, 114)](/../../../tunnel)

Let's start by get in touch with the (30, 36)th as the result of Δ1 shown on the above tabulation in more detail. Then take a look with the behaviour of prime that flow uniformly within an hexagon chart called [The Prime Hexagon](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/) _(Credit: hexspin.com)_.

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/105412087-d0892300-5c66-11eb-9c3e-19d8652b478c.png)](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/)

Here you might see that the number of 10 is the same direction with 19 while 10+19=29=10th prime. By checking all of the loops there is nothing similar to this phenomena. It seems like all the numbers are actually set to let this term happen.

[![Prime Hexagon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74550123-6dd1d680-4f83-11ea-8810-3b8f4f50a9c0.png)](/../../../hexagon)

```tip
You may see that it is clearly showing the 30th Prime of 113=114-1 is routed to 36th Prime of 151=150+1 while both of the 30 and 36 are exactly laid on _[the 18’s Cell](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/18)_:

Take also a note that the next 10 number after 19 right before the 30 which are 20 up to 29 is in laid on the second rows of 17 while _[17's Cell](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/17)_ has 35+65=100=10².
```

See that from this 17's to18's it goes finally to the _[19's Cells](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/19)_ as Δ1 and return to the 2' Cells, 3' Cells and so on.

Therefore all of the numbers that involved in the hexagon can be tabulated by _**Δ1=(19 vs 18) Loops**_ and they are end exactly at 114 on Δ6 & 19's! It means that we have to assign [the 6th repository](https://github.com/eq19/quantum) as **the overall direction**.

 Note:
 - The marked number with  are outside of group Δ18 vs loop(100) = 19 
 - Number 114 located on 6th row vs 19th column whereas 114th prime = 619

  Reference:
  https://github.com/chetabahana/hexagon/pull/2
  https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/
```

See that out of 19 the number 89 is located precissely at the of Δ11 within the end of 12's that goes to 13's Cell. So this is related to the Metratron's Cube. 

```tip
This configuration leads to a **Cyclic in the Loops** as followings:

- Injection goes by 114-π(100)=89 on  Δ11 from 102 to 114-1 or 113
- The 113 is 30th prime where 30, 36 and 102 are laid in the end of rows
- The total of 30+36+102 is exactly 168 which is π(1000)
- The 36th prime which is 151, is reinjected by 151-1 or 150. This 150 is carrying a delta of Δ18 with 168
- The Δ18 brings the 30th and 36th cycled back to 102th thus consequently it goes to the 114th prime
- The 114th prime which is carrying the loop(1000) is reinjected by 619-1 or 618 on the same spot.
```

This Δ(19 vs 18) scenario will duplicate the loops of 618 as _π(89²) of 1000 Primes_. Thus its behaviour will return to _168 Primes of π(1000)_  out of the adjacent scheme. 

So the further process would always continously become the same algorithm.
