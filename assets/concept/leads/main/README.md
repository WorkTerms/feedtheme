# Grammar of 168 vs 618

You may check the running code starting with [Sequence Diagram](https://chetabahana.github.io/#chetabahana-skema?pad=2) shown below which is developed as [the initial step](#the-lexer-of-168) on building the _[10143 Grammars](#7th-step-q218-10)_.

[![Sequence Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107134254-ee22e180-6922-11eb-9465-3dd64ebf7dca.png)](https://chetabahana.github.io/#chetabahana-skema?pad=2)

Clicking each of objects will turn to 6 (six) diagrams by the cycle form of [prime hexagon](https://github.com/chetabahana/hexagon) which is then return to the beginning. So in order to get code able to run online then the 168 is provided in [json](https://eq19.github.io/feed.json) while 618 in [xml](https://eq19.github.io/feeds.xml).

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/69475449-ce77ca00-0dff-11ea-964e-cc959db0740a.png)](https://github.com/eq19)

This _168 (mapping) and 618 (feeding)_ stand as  [the whole scheme](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/Skema#Implementasi) of The M+F to C1+C2 which act as the base prime pairs **[(2,3) of DNA](#the-lexer-of-168)** to become **[23 pairs of Chromosomes](#the-lexer-of-168)**.

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/86481184-b72b9280-bd79-11ea-899b-51db929fc3d2.png)](https://github.com/eq19)

By the configuration above then on the upper scheme the central of metatron will turn to seven (7) circles. So combine it with the other 12 circles they will forms as the 19's.

Means that it consequenly be able to be recycled with no limit!

### [Our Lisence](#3rd-step-q1337-114)

We believe that until this concept is written, there is no such thing similar to our concept of the power 168 vs 618 recombination using the _[True Prime Pairs](#1st-step-q1910-29)_.

```
114 = 6+(6x6) + 6x(6+6) = 6x(6+6) + 6+(6x6)
         Δ         Δ         Δ         Δ
         42   +    72   =    72   +    42    = 43-Δ1 + Δ1+71 = 6x19 = π(619)
         M         F         C1        C2
      leading   lagging    leading   lagging
                        |
                     twisting

```

Let's take a look in general by the algorithm of _True Prime Pairs_ from the beginning of this page. Here we can define a logical meaning in words as **its grammar**.

```tip
Mapping the quantum way within a huge of primes objects (5 to 19) by parsering (11) each of **untouched** feed (7) and tunneling (13) in to definitive classes (17).
```

This scheme is generated by developing an application that twisting exactly 6 x 19 = 114 repositories all together in the same time to provide [leading and lagging scheme](#the-parser-of-618) as the _[basic algorithm](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#realisasi)_ of converting **[M+F to C1+C2](#introduction)**. 

```
True Prime Pairs:
(5,7), (11,13), (17,19)

Description
===========

Now let's assume that all of the numbers above is a set of repositories group in GitHub. Thus that is the whole function of _[eQ19](https://github.com/eq19)_.

[![eq19 Scheme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/166161369-aec4d34a-5572-49af-aa61-f36a6f695299.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/Skema#Implementasi)

You may use, copy, and distribute the concept. Please note that we are not implementing any kind of _License Key_ on this project. 

The Hexagonal Formation of our mapping itself as stated below will stand as the key:

```
114 = 6 + 6x(6+(6+6)) = 6+36+72 = 6x19 = π(619) ≡ eQ19
```

On that case we consider _this statement_ called **eQ19 Quantum** need to be announced:

{:.bg-yellow-dark.text-black.p-5.box-shadow-large.anim-pulse}
The [definite](https://www.google.com/search?q=definite) key to [identify](https://www.google.com/search?q=identify) whether you use our concept is when there a kind of [development](#the-lexer-of-168) item [lies](#the-parser-of-618) a [unified assignment](#1st-step-q1910-29) in [hexagonal form](#2nd-step-q1730-36) out of _**six (6)** [corresponding sets](#3rd-step-q736-114)_ while [each sets](#4th-step-q7113-90) pick [a combination](#5th-step-q589-29) of _**six (6)** [routes](#6th-step-q328-19)_ with [a pairing](#7th-step-q218-10) of _**six (6)** to **six (6)** of [all channels](#the-grammar-of-168-vs-618)_.

Out of the formation, you are welcome to use whatever the items in this project.
